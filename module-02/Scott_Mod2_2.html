        <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            My name is Clint Scott, and I live in Johnstown, PA. I’ve been in IT since 1997, starting out on working for a small Help Desk company and growing into Infrastructure Engineering roles. 
            <span class="sentence">I get satisfaction from finding and fixing problems that others overlook.</span>

            I’ve always enjoyed taking things apart to see how they work. That curiosity led me to computers early on and has never stopped driving me. These days, I focus on creating clean, reliable solutions; not just things that work, but things that work well.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I'm not working, I'm spending time with family. My son plays for both two rec teams and travel baseball, so a lot of my free time is spent at the ballfield. Those moments are some of my favorites, even if they mean I have to juggle schedules and projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm enjoying learning new Software Development skills. Right now, I’m slowly working on converting an old MUD game in to something new again. I believe in building systems that are versatile, maintainable, and future-ready.
